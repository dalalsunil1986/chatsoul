Things to remember before going live:

1.Secure a database username and password.

2.Create a folder and name it "configs" inside the root of the application.

3.Make sure the following folders exist and are read/write configured:
   a.invite
   b.configs
   c.temporaryfiles
   d.uploads
   
4.Configure the application by going to [nameofsite]/setup/configure.php.
  This will create the necessary tables and configuration file.
